# Token Saver

> **💡 Did you know?** Every time you send a prompt, your workspace files (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, and more) are sent along with it — every single time. These files count toward your context window, slowing down responses and costing you real money on every message.

Token Saver compresses these files using AI-efficient notation that preserves all your data while making everything lighter, faster, and cheaper.

## Commands

| Command                    | What it does                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `/optimize`                | Full audit dashboard — files, models, compaction    |
| `/optimize tokens`         | Compress workspace files (auto-backup)              |
| `/optimize compaction`     | Chat compaction control                             |
| `/optimize compaction 120` | Set custom compaction threshold                     |
| `/optimize revert`         | Restore files from backups, disable persistent mode |

## Features

### 📁 Workspace File Compression

Scans all `.md` files sent with each API call. Shows token count and potential savings per file.

**File-aware compression:**

- **SOUL.md** — Light compression, keeps evocative/personality language
- **AGENTS.md** — Medium compression, dense instructions
- **USER.md / MEMORY.md** — Heavy compression, key:value data
- **PROJECTS.md** — No compression (user-specific structure)

### 🤖 Model Audit

Detects current AI models for main chat, cron jobs, and subagents. Suggests cheaper alternatives where appropriate (e.g., Gemini free tier for background tasks).

### 💬 Chat Compaction

Analyzes your conversation history (default: last 7 days) to recommend optimal compaction threshold.

**How it works:**

- Scans your sessions to detect topic change patterns
- Recommends threshold based on YOUR usage
- Shows savings estimate per preset

**Presets:**

- 🟢 Safe (160K) — ~$30/mo savings
- 🟡 Balanced (120K) — ~$100/mo savings
- 🔴 Aggressive (80K) — ~$200/mo savings

**Options:**

- `--month` — Scan last 30 days (more data)
- `--all` — Scan all history (takes longer)
- Custom number: `/optimize compaction 100` = compact at 100K tokens

### 📝 Persistent Mode

When enabled, adds file-type-aware writing guidance to AGENTS.md:

| File         | Writing Style                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| SOUL.md      | Evocative, personality-shaping |
| AGENTS.md    | Dense instructions, symbols OK |
| USER.md      | Key:value facts                |
| MEMORY.md    | Ultra-dense data               |
| memory/\*.md | Log format, dated              |
| PROJECTS.md  | Keep user's structure          |

## Safety

- **Auto-backup** — All modified files get `.backup` extension
- **Integrity > Size** — Never sacrifices meaning for smaller tokens
- **Revert anytime** — `/optimize revert` restores all backups
- **No external calls** — All analysis runs locally

## Installation

```
clawhub install token-saver
```
