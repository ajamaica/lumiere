## Quick Start

### Your First Commands

Try these one-word commands:

```bash
"status"     → See system health instantly
"services"   → Check running services
"optimize"   → Optimize system performance
"fix"        → Auto-fix any issues
```

### What You'll See

**Status Command:**

```
You: "status"
NeuroCore: "✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67% Load:0.45"
```

**Services Command:**

```
You: "services"
NeuroCore: "nginx✓ mysql✓ ssh✓ docker✓"
```

---

## Core Features

### 🧠 1. Cognitive Intelligence

NeuroCore understands context and intent:

**Example:**

```
You: "slow"
NeuroCore: "✓ Optimized: cleared cache, killed zombie processes"
```

It knows you want to speed up the system without explaining every step.

### 🔧 2. Self-Healing Systems

NeuroCore detects and fixes issues automatically:

**Disk Space Management:**

- Monitors disk usage every 5 minutes
- Auto-cleans temp files when >85% full
- Rotates logs automatically
- Frees cache when needed

**Memory Optimization:**

- Tracks memory consumption
- Clears cache when >90% used
- Restarts memory-leaking services
- Optimizes swappiness

**Service Recovery:**

- Watches critical services (nginx, mysql, ssh, docker)
- Restarts failed services within 5 seconds
- Alerts if auto-recovery fails

**Process Management:**

- Kills zombie processes automatically
- Terminates runaway processes
- Manages CPU hogs

### 💰 3. Cost Optimization

**The Problem with Traditional AI:**

```
You: "Can you check my system status and tell me
       about CPU, memory, and disk usage?"
AI: "I'll help you check your system status.
     Let me gather the information..."
[Analyzing...]
"Your CPU usage is currently at 23%, which is normal.
 Your memory usage is 4.2GB out of 8GB total (52%).
 Your disk usage is 67% with 45GB used of 67GB total."
Tokens: 105 | Cost: $0.21
```

**NeuroCore Solution:**

```
You: "status"
NeuroCore: "✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
Tokens: 16 | Cost: $0.032
```

**Savings: 85% per request!**

## Auto-Healing System

### How It Works

NeuroCore runs background monitoring scripts that:

1. **Check every 5 minutes:**
   - Disk space usage
   - Memory consumption
   - System load average
   - Critical service status
   - Zombie processes

2. **Check every 60 seconds:**
   - Recent error logs
   - Authentication failures
   - High CPU processes
   - Network connectivity

### Auto-Healing Examples

**Example 1: Critical Disk Space**

```
[2:15 PM] Disk usage: 87%
[2:15 PM] NeuroCore: Auto-cleaning initiated
[2:15 PM] NeuroCore: Removed 4.2GB temp files
[2:15 PM] Disk usage: 64%
You see: "⚠ Auto-resolved: Disk space optimized"
```

**Example 2: Memory Pressure**

```
[3:30 PM] Memory usage: 91%
[3:30 PM] NeuroCore: Clearing cache
[3:30 PM] Memory usage: 74%
You see: Nothing (fixed silently)
```

**Example 3: Service Failure**

```
[4:45 PM] nginx service crashed
[4:45 PM] NeuroCore: Detected failure
[4:45 PM] NeuroCore: Restarting nginx
[4:46 PM] nginx: active (running)
You see: "⚠ Auto-recovered: nginx restarted"
```

### Viewing Logs

Check what NeuroCore has been doing:

```bash
# Auto-fix log
tail ~/.openclaw/monitor/health.log

# Error log
tail ~/.openclaw/monitor/errors.log

# All activity
ls -la ~/.openclaw/monitor/
```

## Cost Savings

### Real Numbers

**Scenario: Developer Using OpenClaw Daily**

**Without NeuroCore:**

- 150 requests/day
- Average 100 tokens/request
- Daily: 15,000 tokens = $30.00
- Monthly: 450,000 tokens = $900.00

**With NeuroCore:**

- 150 requests/day
- Average 15 tokens/request
- Daily: 2,250 tokens = $4.50
- Monthly: 67,500 tokens = $135.00

**Monthly Savings: $765.00 (85% reduction!)**

### How NeuroCore Saves Money

1. **Ultra-Concise Responses**
   - No verbose explanations
   - Symbol-based status (✓ ✗ ⚠)
   - Data-dense output

2. **Smart Caching**
   - System stats cached 5 minutes
   - Command results cached 10 minutes
   - Avoids redundant API calls

3. **Batch Operations**
   - One command = multiple checks
   - "status" checks CPU, memory, disk
   - Reduces total requests

4. **Silent Operation**
   - Works in background
   - No unnecessary confirmations
   - Only reports important events

## Advanced Usage

### Progressive Detail

Start simple, get details when needed:

**Level 1 - Brief:**

```
You: "status"
NeuroCore: "✓ CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
```

**Level 2 - Summary:**

```
You: "status summary"
NeuroCore: "CPU:23% (4 cores) | Mem:4.2G/8G | Disk:67% (45G/67G) | Load:0.45"
```

**Level 3 - Detailed:**

```
You: "status detailed"
NeuroCore: [Full system breakdown with top processes, network stats, etc.]
```

### Combined Commands

Check multiple things at once:

```bash
"cpu memory disk" → "CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67%"
"status services" → "CPU:23% Mem:4G Disk:67% Services: nginx✓ mysql✓"
```

### Custom Monitoring

Set up custom alerts:

```bash
"watch cpu > 80"      → Alerts when CPU > 80%
"watch memory > 90"   → Alerts when memory > 90%
"watch disk > 85"     → Alerts when disk > 85%
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Skill not found"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if installed
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/neurocore-ai/

# Reinstall
cp -r neurocore-ai ~/.openclaw/skills/
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway &
```

### Issue: "Commands not working"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify skill is loaded
openclaw skills list | grep neurocore

# Check agent config
cat ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent.json | grep neurocore

# Restart if needed
pkill -f "openclaw gateway"
openclaw gateway &
```

### Issue: "Too verbose"

**This is not NeuroCore!**

If you're getting long responses, the skill might not be active. Check:

```bash
openclaw skills list
```

Should show: `✓ ready   🧠 neurocore-ai`

### Issue: "Not auto-fixing"

**Check monitoring scripts:**

```bash
ls -la ~/.openclaw/monitor/
```

Should see:

- health_check.sh
- log_watch.sh
- optimizer.sh

If missing, restart OpenClaw.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Short Commands

```
❌ "Can you please check the current CPU usage?"
✅ "cpu"
```

### 2. Trust Silent Operation

```
NeuroCore works in the background.
You don't need to check constantly.
It will alert you if something needs attention.
```

### 3. Batch Requests

```
❌ "cpu" [wait] "memory" [wait] "disk"
✅ "cpu memory disk"
```

### 4. Learn the Symbols

```
✓ = Everything good
✗ = Problem (NeuroCore will try to fix)
⚠ = Issue auto-fixed
→ = Working on it
```
