# 🔧 SafeExec v0.1.3 - Configuration Fix Report

**Date**: 2026-02-01 02:10 UTC
**Version**: v0.1.2 → v0.1.3
**Type**: Bug Fix (Configuration)

---

## 🐛 Bug Report

**Reported by**: main Agent
**Issue**: SafeExec was incorrectly configured as a Plugin instead of a Skill

### Symptoms

```
[WARN] plugin skill path not found (safe-exec):
       /home/otto/.openclaw/extensions/safe-exec/safe-exec
```

**Impact**:

- ⚠️ Warning logs on every Gateway startup
- ✅ Functionality was not affected
- ❓ Confusion about Plugin vs Skill architecture

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### The Problem

SafeExec was **dual-deployed**:

1. **Plugin Version** (`~/.openclaw/extensions/safe-exec/`)
   - TypeScript implementation
   - Registered in `plugins.entries.safe-exec`
   - ❌ Incorrect architecture

2. **Skill Version** (`~/.openclaw/skills/safe-exec/`)
   - Bash script implementation
   - Loaded from `skills.load.extraDirs`
   - ✅ Correct architecture

### Why This Was Wrong

| Aspect       | Plugin               | Skill                   |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Extend OpenClaw core | Tools for Agents        |
| **Example**  | Feishu channel       | Web search, TTS         |
| **Language** | TypeScript           | Any (bash, py, etc.)    |
| **Location** | `extensions/`        | `skills/`               |
| **Config**   | `plugins.entries`    | `skills.load.extraDirs` |

**SafeExec is a Skill** because:

- It's a tool that Agents use to run commands safely
- It's implemented in Bash
- It's called via `safe-exec` command

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Plugin Version

```bash
rm -rf ~/.openclaw/extensions/safe-exec
```

### 2. Updated Configuration

**Before** (`openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "feishu": { "enabled": true },
      "safe-exec": {              // ❌ Incorrect
        "enabled": true,
        "config": { ... }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After** (`openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "feishu": { "enabled": true }
      // ✅ safe-exec removed
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Verified Skill Version

```bash
# Skill version exists and works
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/safe-exec/
# → safe-exec.sh, SKILL.md, README.md, etc.

# SafeExec works as expected
safe-exec "echo test"
# → Test successful
```

---

## 🎯 Result

### Before Fix

```
❌ [WARN] plugin skill path not found (safe-exec)
❌ Confusing dual deployment
❌ Wrong architecture
```

### After Fix

```
✅ No warning logs
✅ Single deployment (Skill only)
✅ Correct architecture
✅ Clean configuration
```

## 📝 Version Bump

**v0.1.2** → **v0.1.3** (Patch version)

**Rationale**: Configuration fix, no functional changes

**CHANGELOG entry**:

```markdown
## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- Removed incorrect SafeExec plugin configuration
- SafeExec is now properly configured as a Skill
- Eliminated startup warning logs
```

---

## 🧪 Verification

### Test 1: No Warning Logs

```bash
tail -100 /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log | grep -i "safe-exec.*warn"
# → (no output = success)
```

### Test 2: Skill Works

```bash
safe-exec "echo 'Hello from SafeExec'"
# → Hello from SafeExec
```

### Test 3: Config Clean

```bash
jq '.plugins.entries | keys' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
# → ["feishu"]
# (safe-exec not present = success)
```

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### 1. Plugin vs Skill

**Rule of Thumb**:

- **Plugin** = Extension to OpenClaw itself (channels, hooks, core features)
- **Skill** = Tool that Agents use (search, compute, APIs)

### 2. Single Source of Truth

Avoid dual deployments. Choose one approach:

- If Plugin → Delete Skill version
- If Skill → Delete Plugin version

### 3. Configuration Hygiene

- Remove unused entries from config
- Test after config changes
- Monitor logs for warnings
