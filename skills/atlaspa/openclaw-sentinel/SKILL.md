# OpenClaw Sentinel

Supply chain security scanner for agent skills. Detects obfuscated code, known-bad signatures, suspicious install behaviors, dependency confusion, and metadata inconsistencies — before and after installation.

## The Problem

You install skills from the community. Any skill can contain obfuscated payloads, post-install hooks that execute arbitrary code, or supply chain attacks that modify other skills in your workspace. Existing tools verify file integrity after the fact — nothing inspects skills for supply chain risks before they run.

**Need automated countermeasures?** Upgrade to [openclaw-sentinel-pro](https://github.com/AtlasPA/openclaw-sentinel-pro) for quarantine, blocking, community threat feeds, SBOM generation, and continuous monitoring.

## Commands

### Scan Installed Skills

Deep scan of all installed skills for supply chain risks. Checks file hashes against a local threat database, detects obfuscated code patterns, suspicious install behaviors, dependency confusion, and metadata inconsistencies. Generates a risk score (0-100) per skill.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py scan --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Scan a Single Skill

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py scan openclaw-warden --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Pre-Install Inspection

Scan a skill directory BEFORE copying it to your workspace. Outputs a SAFE/REVIEW/REJECT recommendation and shows exactly what binaries, network calls, and file operations the skill will perform.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py inspect /path/to/skill-directory
```

### Manage Threat Database

View current threat database statistics.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py threats --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

Import a community-shared threat list.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py threats --update-from threats.json --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

### Quick Status

Summary of installed skills, scan history, and risk score overview.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/sentinel.py status --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

## Workspace Auto-Detection

If `--workspace` is omitted, the script tries:

1. `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` environment variable
2. Current directory (if AGENTS.md exists)
3. `~/.openclaw/workspace` (default)

## What It Detects

| Category                 | Patterns                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encoded Execution**    | eval(base64.b64decode(...)), exec(compile(...)), eval/exec with encoded strings |
| **Dynamic Imports**      | \_\_import\_\_('os').system(...), dynamic subprocess/ctypes imports             |
| **Shell Injection**      | subprocess.Popen with shell=True + string concatenation, os.system()            |
| **Remote Code Exec**     | urllib/requests combined with exec/eval — download-and-run patterns             |
| **Obfuscation**          | Lines >1000 chars, high-entropy strings, minified code blocks                   |
| **Install Behaviors**    | Post-install hooks, auto-exec in \_\_init\_\_.py, cross-skill file writes       |
| **Hidden Files**         | Non-standard dotfiles and hidden directories                                    |
| **Dependency Confusion** | Skills shadowing popular package names, typosquatting near-matches              |
| **Metadata Mismatch**    | Undeclared binaries, undeclared env vars, invocable flag inconsistencies        |
| **Serialization**        | pickle.loads, marshal.loads — arbitrary code execution via deserialization      |
| **Known-Bad Hashes**     | File SHA-256 matches against local threat database                              |

## Risk Scoring

Each skill receives a score from 0-100:

| Score  | Label    | Meaning                           |
| ------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0      | CLEAN    | No issues detected                |
| 1-19   | LOW      | Minor findings, likely benign     |
| 20-49  | MODERATE | Review recommended                |
| 50-74  | HIGH     | Significant risk, review required |
| 75-100 | CRITICAL | Serious supply chain risk         |

## Threat Database Format

Community-shared threat lists use this JSON format:

```json
{
  "hashes": {
    "<sha256hex>": { "name": "...", "severity": "...", "description": "..." }
  },
  "patterns": [{ "name": "...", "regex": "...", "severity": "..." }]
}
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` — Clean, no issues
- `1` — Review needed
- `2` — Threats detected

## No External Dependencies

Python standard library only. No pip install. No network calls. Everything runs locally.

## Cross-Platform

Works with OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, and any tool using the Agent Skills specification.
