## Example Response

```json
{
  "market_a": {
    "question": "Will the Fed cut rates?",
    "yes_price": 0.72
  },
  "market_b": {
    "question": "Will S&P hit 6000?",
    "yes_price": 0.45
  },
  "analysis": {
    "pattern_type": "category",
    "expected_price_b": 0.61,
    "actual_price_b": 0.45,
    "mispricing": 0.16
  },
  "signal": {
    "action": "BUY_YES_B",
    "strength": "strong",
    "reason": "Market B underpriced by 16%"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

PolyEdge analyzes correlations between prediction markets:

1. **Category Correlation** - Markets in related categories (economics, politics) tend to move together
2. **Causal Patterns** - Event A triggering Event B creates predictable price relationships
3. **Mispricing Detection** - When actual prices diverge from expected correlations, that's alpha
