## What is FearBot?

FearBot turns your OpenClaw agent into a structured CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) companion for the full spectrum of common mental health concerns. It provides:

- 📊 **Validated Assessments** — GAD-7, PHQ-9, DASS-21, PCL-5 with clinical scoring
- 🔍 **Differential Diagnosis** — Screens for anxiety, depression, panic, OCD, PTSD
- 📝 **Session Tracking** — Persistent history, mood logs, homework assignments
- 💭 **Thought Records** — Quick logging for any distressing moment
- 🚨 **Crisis Detection** — Three-tier safety system with automatic escalation
- 🧠 **CBT Techniques** — Cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, exposure, grounding

## The Context Advantage

Traditional therapy apps don't know your life. FearBot works best with a fully-integrated OpenClaw agent that already has context from your daily messages, work stress, relationships, and everything in between.

**No cold start. No "catch me up." Your agent already knows your week.**

## ⚠️ Important
